=head1 Name

Unexpected::TraitFor::Throwing - Detects and throws exceptions

=head1 Synopsis

   use Moo;

   with 'Unexpected::TraitFor::Throwing';

=head1 Description

Detects and throws exceptions

=head1 Configuration and Environment

Modifies C<BUILD> in the consuming class. Caches the new exception for
use by the C<previous_exception> attribute in the next exception thrown

Requires the consuming class to have the class method C<is_one_of_us>

Defines the following list of attributes;

=over 3

=item C<previous_exception>

May hold a reference to the previous exception in this thread

=back

=head1 Subroutines/Methods

=head2 BUILD

After construction the current exception is cached so that it can become
the previous exception the next time an exception is thrown

=head2 caught

   $exception_object_ref = Unexpected->caught( @optional_args );

Catches and returns a thrown exception or generates a new exception if
C<$EVAL_ERROR> has been set. Returns either an exception object or undef

=head2 throw

   Unexpected->throw 'Path [_1] not found', args => [ 'pathname' ];

Create (or re-throw) an exception. If the passed parameter is a
blessed reference it is re-thrown. If a single scalar is passed it is
taken to be an error message, a new exception is created with all
other parameters taking their default values. If more than one
parameter is passed the it is treated as a list and used to
instantiate the new exception. The 'error' parameter must be provided
in this case

=head2 throw_on_error

   Unexpected->throw_on_error( @optional_args );

Calls L</caught> passing in the options C<@args> and if there was an
exception L</throw>s it
