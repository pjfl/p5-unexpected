Unexpected::TraitFor::TracingStacks - Provides a minimalist stacktrace

=head1 Synopsis

   use Moo;

   with 'Unexpected::TraitFor::TracingStacks';

=head1 Description

Provides a minimalist stacktrace

=head1 Configuration and Environment

Modifies C<BUILD> in the consuming class. Forces the instantiation of
the C<trace> attribute

Defines the following attributes;

=over 3

=item C<trace>

An instance of the C<trace_class>

=item C<trace_args>

A hash ref of arguments passed the C<trace_class> constructor when the
C<trace> attribute is instantiated

=item C<trace_class>

A loadable class which defaults to L<Devel::StackTrace>

=back

=head1 Subroutines/Methods

=head2 message

   $error_text_and_stack_trace = $self->message;

Returns the stringified object and a full stack trace

=head2 stacktrace

   $lines = $self->stacktrace( $num_frames_to_skip );

Returns a minimalist stack trace. Defaults to skipping zero frames
from the stack

=head2 trace_frame_filter

Lifted from L<StackTrace::Auto> this method filters out frames from the
raw stacktrace that are not of interest. It is very clever

=head1 Diagnostics

None
